This an example web app for demonstrating how to use CITIEsForRAILS gem. (see http://testaltrabio1.github.com/altrabioCVI/)

This app is an implementation of a kind of Multimedia Library (either Media, Unknown, Audio, Mp3, Video, Book, Dictiponary, Pocket Dictionary, Novel go to http://testaltrabio1.github.com/altrabioCVI/ to learn more about medias and medias inheritance hierarchy). 


You can populate the database either by :
- adding manually some medias, just go to the desired media (Media, Unknown, Audio, Mp3, Video, Book, Dictiponary, Pocket Dictionary, Novel) list and follow the new Media link.
- adding automatically some medias : just follow the populate database link (this will add some medias for each media class and will also add some comments for these medias)
- adding manually some comments for medias : go to the comments list and follow the new commment link
- adding manually some book comments for medias inheriting from book class (Book, Novel, Dictionary, PocketDictionary)  : go to the book comments list and follow the new book commment link

We hope you won't need more explanations...

We hope this demo app will be useful too...
